"""Two-agent demo proving cross-session knowledge transfer via the
two-tier architecture. Agent A completes a quest in session 1; agent B,
spawned later in session 2, has the knowledge available via EverCore's
semantic recall, then claims its own quest in guild.

Identity model (W3.5.5 §2.1): one TieredMemory instance per agent.
The agent_id ctor arg is a Python-side label propagated into EverCore
imprint metadata; guild's MCP session itself is anonymous.
